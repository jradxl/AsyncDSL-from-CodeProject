AsyncDSL-from-CodeProject
=========================

VS 2012 version of "Working with DSL Tools: An Asynchronous Graphical DSL" From CodeProject

Projects generate DSL and DSLPackge, which can be opened in Debugging.sln -> Sample.async
Debugging.exe now runs. Fixed issue with AsyncDslReport.tt to use ExampleModel.Processes, and other minor issues.
Incorporated the CommentShape Dash fix in DSL: CustomCode
